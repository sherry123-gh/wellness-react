              Nutrition is about eating a healthy and balanced diet. Food and
              drink provide the energy and nutrients you need to be healthy.
              Understanding these nutrition terms may make it easier for you to
              make better food choices.

            Nutrients are normally divided into five categories: Water, protein,
            carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Water is the main constituent
            of the body. Two‚Äêthirds of the body is water, thus, an animal can
            live much longer without feed than water. Water helps the body
            digest food and carries nutrients to body tissues.

              Why Nutrition is Important for a Healthy and Balanced Diet
            </h3>
            <p className="txt">
              A healthy, balanced diet looks different for each person, as
              nutrition needs vary based on gender, height, weight, activity
              level, and many more factors. When thinking about what is
              "healthy" and "balanced" for you, there are many considerations.
              Think about taste preferences, nutrition needs, cooking ability,
              medical conditions, budget, and more. Planning a daily menu isn't
              difficult as long as each meal and snack has some protein, fiber,
              complex carbohydrates, and a little bit of fat.1 USDA. 2020-2025
              Dietary Guidelines for Americans. You may want to plan
              approximately 100 to 250 calories for each snack and 300 to 600
              calories per meal; however, you may need more or less depending on
              your hunger levels and energy needs.

                What to Eat for a Healthy Balanced Diet
              </span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              A healthy diet generally includes a combination of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="subs">Vegetables:</span> Always a smart choice,
                aim to fill about half your plate with veggies. Add plenty of
                cruciferous veggies like broccoli, leafy greens, as well as
                colorful options like peppers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="subs">Fruits:</span> Go for fresh fruit
                whenever possible and try a variety of colors. Berries, grapes,
                apples, and grapefruits make great choices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="subs">Whole grains:</span> Eating grains in
                their whole form provides additional fiber and nutrients. This
                includes brown rice, oats, and 100% whole grain breads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="subs">Lean protein:</span> High in protein and
                relatively low in fat, lean proteins include grilled chicken,
                ground turkey, and white fish.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="subs">Healthy fats:</span> Fatty fish, such as
                salmon and tuna, as well as nuts, such as walnuts, provide
                essential omega-3 fatty acids. Avocados are a great source of
                beneficial unsaturated fats.

                  How to Meal Plan for a Healthy, Balanced Diet
                </span>
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Eating breakfast will help you start your day with plenty of
                  energy. Choose protein and fiber for your breakfast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mid-morning snack is totally optional. If you eat a larger
                  breakfast, you may not feel hungry until lunchtime. However,
                  if you're feeling a bit hungry and lunch is still two or three
                  hours away, a light mid-morning snack provide satiety.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lunch is often something you eat at work or school, so it's a
                  great time to pack a sandwich or leftovers that you can heat
                  and eat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A mid-afternoon snack is also optional. Prioritize protein,
                  healthy fat, and fiber to keep you going until dinnertime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dinner can sometimes feel like a feat to cook and prep, but it
                  can be very simple. Consider stocking up on meal prep
                  containers so you can chop and store vegetables ahead of time,
                  as well as easily reheat food. For an easy trick, mentally
                  divide your plate into four quarters. One-quarter is for your
                  meat or protein source, one-quarter is for a complex
                  carbohydrate, and the last two quarters are for green and
                  colorful vegetables or a green salad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A complex carbohydrate-rich evening snack may help you sleep.
                  Avoid snacking on high sugar items before bedtime.
